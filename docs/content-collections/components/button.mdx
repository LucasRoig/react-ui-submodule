# Button

To trigger an operation.

## When To Use

A button means an operation (or a series of operations). Clicking a button will trigger its corresponding business logic.

In Ant Design we provide 5 types of button.

* Primary button: used for the main action, there can be at most one primary button in a section.
* Default button: used for a series of actions without priority.
  * Dashed button: commonly used for adding more actions.
    * Text button: used for the most secondary action.
  * Link button: used for external links.

And 4 other properties additionally.

* danger: used for actions of risk, like deletion or authorization.
* ghost: used in situations with complex background, home pages usually.
* disabled: used when actions are not available.
* loading: adds a loading spinner in button, avoids multiple submits too.
